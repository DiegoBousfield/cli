# Start Project CLI

This project was created with the goal of learning how to create a CLI, because of that it's not published on NPM (yet!)

## How to install

* Clone the repositorie
* Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the depencies
* Create a symlink with `npm link` or `yarn link`

## How to use it 

* After creating the symlink, run command `create-project`
* If you want to install the target boilerplate dependencies, use the `--install` argument
